# HealthSync:BlockChain Based Medical Records System with AI
 

## Overview

Welcome to the Ethereum Health Records DApp! This decentralized application is designed to provide a secure and transparent electronic health records (EHR) system on the Ethereum blockchain. Patients can manage their health records, securely share them with doctors, and interact with the system using Metamask for a seamless and decentralized experience.

## Features

- **Decentralized Health Records:**
  - Patients can create and manage their electronic health records on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring data integrity and security.

- **Metamask Integration:**
  - Seamless integration with Metamask allows users to interact with the DApp using their Ethereum wallet. Patients can pay gas fees, sign transactions, and securely manage their health data.

- **Blockchain Security:**
  - Smart contracts, written in Solidity, power the system, ensuring tamper-proof health records and transparent access controls.

- **Gas-Based Transactions:**
  - Each action within the DApp, such as registering, providing access to doctors, or updating records, incurs a gas cost. Metamask handles gas payments through the user's wallet.

- **Chatbot Assistance:**
  - A GPT-powered chatbot is integrated to provide users with accurate and timely responses to queries, enhancing the overall user experience.
